The Inscription web application is designed to streamline the enrollment process for students at LUMS. The application incorporates several key features to assist students in course selection and degree planning. The primary feature is a clash resolver, which generates feasible weekly schedules based on a student's intended course load, ensuring no class overlaps. The platform also facilitates course exchange and offers tailored solutions for degree planning. A unique aspect of the application is the integration of an OpenAI-powered chatbot. This chatbot serves as a virtual academic advisor, providing guidance on course selection for the current semester, ensuring timely graduation, and advising on course selection for minor declaration. The Inscription web application aims to simplify the academic planning process, providing a user-friendly interface for students to navigate their academic journey at LUMS.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
